> ### What are Fascinating Numbers?

**Take a number, multiply it by 1, then multiply the same number by 2 as well as by 3. Now, concat all the three results and check whether the result contains all the digits from 1 to 9. If the result contains all the digits from 1 to 9, then that number is called the Fascinating Number.**
